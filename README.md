  description: The app uses riverpod as state management solution and go_router to route the pages.
  it is very simple app with couple of pages. One is main_page and the other one is detail.
  As data source, the news.org api has been used through dio package to call for news data. 
  have tried to make the app as flexible as possible for different size screens.
